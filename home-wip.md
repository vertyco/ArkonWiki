# Work In Progress

Hey everyone!

Just wanted to pop in and give you all a quick update on what's happening here. As you've probably noticed, we're under a bit of construction!

### Revamping Arkon

I'm currently in the midst of a pretty significant rewrite of the ArkTools codebase for Arkon. I want to ensure that your experience with the bot is smoother, more intuitive, and just generally better than ever before. As with building anything great, it takes a little time and patience. Trust me, it'll be worth the wait!

### Documentation HQ

While I'm tinkering with the code, our usual documentation is getting a thoughtful makeover too. For just a while, you might find that not everything matches up perfectly with the new changes being made.

Here's the scoop:

- Some commands might behave a bit differently or have additional features.
- The current guidelines may not completely align with the latest updates.
- Detailed tutorials on new features are in the works and will be ready soon.

### Stay Tuned and Connect

We've got a fabulous little community going, and I want you all to stay informed about every step of this journey:

- **Arkon's Hangout**: Check back on [wiki.ArkonBot.com](https://wiki.arkonbot.com/) for all the shiny new documentation once it's live.
- **Join the Crew**: Swing by and say hi on the [Arkon Support Server](https://discord.gg/RaR3wR4MgY). I'm usually hanging around there too!
- **Get the Buzz**: Keep an eye out for my updates and announcements in the server.

### Got Questions or Need a Hand?

I'm here for it. If you need help or want to know more about what's cooking for Arkon, come chat in our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/RaR3wR4MgY). Your feedback and questions are welcome!

Huge thanks for everyone's understanding as we go through this exciting overhaul. Your support fuels the drive to make Arkon extraordinary, and I can't wait for you all to see what's in store.

Keep being awesome,
Vertyco
