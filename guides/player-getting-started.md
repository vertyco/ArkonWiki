## 🔗 Linking your Discord
To use features like the Rshop and some in-game commands, you will first need to link your Discord account to your in-game account. The easiest way to do this is from in-game.

Type `+register <YourDiscord>` **IN-GAME** in global chat to link your Discord account.
For example my discord username is vertyco so I would type `+register vertyco` in-game.

> Congrats, your Discord should now be linked! Run `+playerstats` in the Discord to see your in-game player.
> You can now also use the `+rshop` command to purchase items.

> `+register` also works in Discord, but only for ASE servers.

### Xbox/PC Crossplay
If the server you play on is hosted via Microsoft store version and has a host Gamertag, you can make the host Gamertag add you as a friend so that you can easily join its session.
Simply run `+addme` and select a server, the host Gamertag for that map will add you as a friend, you can add it back and should then be able to go to its profile page and click `Join Game`

> The server owner needs to authenticate their host gamertags with the Xbox API for this to work
