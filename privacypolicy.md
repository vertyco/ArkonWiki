By using Arkon and interacting with our service, you represent and warrant that you agree to our privacy policy.

# Data collected and usage
Arkon collects some amount of data about users for the bots normal operation. 
Specifically, this is the ID of your Discord user account, which is linked to a 
handful of things depending on how you interact with the bot.

Discord IDs can be stored so that the bot can take the appropriate actions for specific 
users and respect settings that have been set. Such as: any user or server setting that 
you configure through the bot, moderation actions against your Discord account if enabled 
in a server where the bot is in, or any interaction with the bot that requires storing your 
Discord user ID.

# Messages content usages
Arkon uses message content to enable bi-synchronous chat between Discord and Ark servers that 
have been configured on it. Message content is also used in the leveling system for servers that 
have configured a 'minimum message length' for messages that count toward the gaining of experience points.

This data is not stored on the bot and is instead only passed between the channel and ark server.

# Data security
Any collected information is high value for us, and as such it is stored securely and being encrypted. 
It is also not shared with any third party services.

# Data removal
You have the right to request removal of your data. We will process your request within 30 days after it being reviewed.
Please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RaR3wR4MgY) and open a ticket asking for such requests.
